This is an experimental game engine test using Horde3D beta for rendering, 
Newton Dynamics(3.0 beta) for physics, and Ogg Vorbis for audio.
The project was in the process of porting for building on multiple platforms, 
so not all components are ready.  The physics integration has worked successfully in testing, 
so the use of the relevant functions should work as long as they are updated for the latest library versions.
